# FastAPI Student Management App

## Overview
This project entails building a FastAPI application that serves as a management system for a global student list stored in memory. The goal is to develop a RESTful API using FastAPI, enabling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data.

## Functionality
- Create a global list of students stored in memory.
- Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for students:
    - `GET /`: Retrieve Owner Detail.
    - `GET /students`: Retrieve all students.
    - `GET /students/{student_id}`: Retrieve specific student details.
    - `POST /students`: Add a new student.
    - `PUT /students/{student_id}`: Update a student's details.
    - `DELETE /students/{student_id}`: Delete a student.

## Technology Stack
- Python
- FastAPI

## Student Data Schema
Each student object should have the following attributes:
- Student ID (unique)
- Name
- Age
- Grade/Class

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Poetry package manager

### Steps

1. **Install project dependencies using Poetry:**
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

2. **Run the FastAPI application:**
    ```bash
    poetry run dev
    ```

3. **Access the API documentation:**
    After launching the application, you can explore the API documentation by navigating to  [http://localhost:8080/docs](http://localhost:8080/docs)  in your web browser. This interactive documentation, dynamically generated by FastAPI, offers comprehensive information on the accessible endpoints, request and response structures, and facilitates direct testing of the API endpoints from within the browser.
