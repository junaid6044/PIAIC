    text: "A JavaScript runtime is a software environment that executes JavaScript code. JavaScript is a programming language that was originally designed for creating dynamic web pages in browsers. However, JavaScript can also be used for other purposes, such as server-side programming, desktop applications, mobile apps, and even games.To run JavaScript code outside of browsers, you need a JavaScript runtime that can interpret and execute the code. A JavaScript runtime typically consists of two main components: a JavaScript engine and a set of APIs. A JavaScript engine is a program that parses, compiles, and executes JavaScript code. Different JavaScript engines have different performance and features. Some of the most popular JavaScript engines are V8 (used by Chrome and Node.js), SpiderMonkey (used by Firefox), and JavaScriptCore (used by Safari and Bun). A set of APIs are functions and objects that provide access to various features and functionalities of the system, such as file system, network, timers, events, etc. Different JavaScript runtimes have different APIs. For example, browsers have APIs for manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model), making AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) requests, using Web Storage, etc. Node.js has APIs for creating servers, working with streams, using buffers, etc.",

    text: `<div><h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>If you are a web developer who works with SQL databases, you might have heard of TypeScript ORM tools. These are libraries that allow you to write SQL queries in a type-safe and expressive way using TypeScript, a programming language that adds types to JavaScript. TypeScript ORM tools can help you simplify your code, prevent errors, and improve your productivity.</p>
    <p>But which TypeScript ORM tool should you use in 2023? There are many options available, but two of the most popular ones are Drizzle and Prisma. Drizzle and Prisma are both modern and powerful tools that let you work with SQL databases in a fluent and intuitive way. However, they have some differences in their design, features, and performance that might make one of them more suitable for your needs than the other.</p>
    <p>In this blog post, we will compare Drizzle and Prisma in terms of their features, performance, compatibility, simplicity, flexibility, and future prospects. We will also share our personal opinion and experience with each tool and give you some tips and best practices for using them. By the end of this blog post, you will have a clear answer to the question: Which TypeScript ORM tool is faster, simpler, and more flexible in 2023? Read on to find out!</p>
    <h2>Comparison: Features, Performance, Compatibility</h2>
    <p>Let's start by comparing Drizzle and Prisma in terms of their features, performance, and compatibility. These are some of the most important aspects to consider when choosing a TypeScript ORM tool.</p>
    <h3>Features</h3>
    <p>Drizzle and Prisma both offer a rich set of features that make SQL development easier and more enjoyable. Here are some of the features that they have in common:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>They support various platforms, drivers, and dialects, such as Node.js, Deno, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and more. You can use Drizzle or Prisma with any SQL database that you prefer or are familiar with.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>They integrate with Zod, a TypeScript schema validation library, to provide extra type safety and validation for your data models. You can use Zod to define the shape and constraints of your data, and Drizzle or Prisma will automatically infer the types and validate the values for you.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>They offer a fluent and chainable query builder that allows you to write complex queries with ease. You can use methods like select, where, join, orderBy, limit, offset, and more to build your queries in a readable and composable way.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>They support various query types, such as raw queries, parameterized queries, prepared statements, transactions, batch operations, and more. You can use the query type that suits your needs and performance requirements.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, Drizzle and Prisma also have some differences in their features that might make one of them more appealing or convenient than the other. Here are some of the features that they differ in:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>Drizzle infers the types from your schema file and uses them with its TypeScript API that resembles SQL syntax. Prisma generates a TypeScript API based on your schema file that you can use to query your database.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Drizzle handles complex queries with multiple JOINs by using subqueries that fetch the related data in one query. Prisma handles complex queries with multiple JOINs by using add-on queries that fetch the related data separately.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Drizzle provides hooks and events that let you customize the behavior of your queries and models. You can use hooks like beforeCreate, afterCreate, beforeUpdate, afterUpdate, and more to execute some logic before or after certain actions. You can also use events like onQueryStart, onQueryEnd, onQueryError, and more to listen to the events that occur during the query execution. Prisma does not provide hooks or events at the moment, but it is working on adding them in the future.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Performance</h3>
    <p>Drizzle and Prisma both claim to be fast and performant tools that optimize your SQL queries and reduce your database load. However, there are some factors that might affect their performance differently depending on your environment and use case.</p>
    <p>One of the factors is the bundle size and memory footprint of each tool. The bundle size is the amount of code that each tool adds to your application when you install it as a dependency. The memory footprint is the amount of memory that each tool consumes when you run it on your server or device. These factors can affect the performance and cold start time of serverless environments, such as AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Azure Functions.</p>
    <p>According to a benchmark conducted by the Drizzle team, Drizzle has a smaller bundle size and memory footprint than Prisma. Drizzle's bundle size is about 1.5 MB, while Prisma's bundle size is about 6.5 MB. Drizzle's memory footprint is about 30 MB, while Prisma's memory footprint is about 80 MB. This means that Drizzle might have an advantage over Prisma in terms of performance and cold start time in serverless environments.</p>
    <p>Another factor is the query speed of each tool. The query speed is the amount of time that each tool takes to execute a SQL query and return the result. This factor can affect the performance and user experience of your application, especially if you have complex or frequent queries.</p>
    <p>According to another benchmark conducted by the Drizzle team, Drizzle and Prisma have similar query speeds for simple queries, such as selecting or inserting a single row. However, Drizzle has a faster query speed than Prisma for complex queries, such as selecting or inserting multiple rows with relations. This means that Drizzle might have an advantage over Prisma in terms of performance and user experience for complex queries.</p>
    <h3>Compatibility</h3>
    <p>Drizzle and Prisma both aim to be compatible with various platforms, drivers, and dialects, as well as with other tools and frameworks that you might use in your development stack. However, they have some differences in their compatibility that might affect your choice depending on your preferences or requirements.</p>
    <p>One of the differences is the supported platforms. The supported platforms are the environments where you can run each tool and access your database. Drizzle supports Node.js and Deno, two popular JavaScript runtime environments that allow you to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Prisma supports Node.js, but not Deno at the moment. However, Prisma is working on adding support for Deno in the future.</p>
    <p>Another difference is the supported drivers and dialects. The supported drivers are the software components that enable each tool to communicate with your database. The supported dialects are the variations of SQL that each tool can understand and generate. Drizzle supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite drivers and dialects. Prisma supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, MongoDB, and CockroachDB drivers and dialects.</p>
    <p>A third difference is the integrations with other tools and frameworks. The integrations are the connections or collaborations that each tool has with other tools and frameworks that you might use in your development stack, such as web frameworks, testing tools, logging tools, etc. Drizzle integrates with Zod, a TypeScript schema validation library, to provide extra type safety and validation for your data models. Prisma integrates with Zod as well as with other tools and frameworks, such as Next.js, NestJS, Apollo Server, Jest, Pino, etc.</p>
    <p>Evaluation: Simplicity, Flexibility, Future Prospects
    Now that we have compared Drizzle and Prisma in terms of their features, performance, and compatibility, let's evaluate them in terms of their simplicity, flexibility, and future prospects. These are some of the aspects that can influence your satisfaction and enjoyment with each tool.</p>
    <h3>Simplicity</h3>
    <p>Drizzle and Prisma both strive to be simple and easy to use tools that make SQL development fun and productive. However, they have some differences in their simplicity that might make one of them more appealing or convenient than the other.</p>
    <p>One of the differences is the learning curve of each tool. The learning curve is the amount of time and effort that it takes to learn and master each tool. Drizzle has a lower learning curve than Prisma because it uses a syntax that resembles SQL. If you know SQL, you know Drizzle ORM. Prisma has a higher learning curve than Drizzle because it uses a syntax that abstracts away the SQL details. You need to learn how to use Prisma's TypeScript API to query your database.</p>
    <p>Another difference is the documentation of each tool. The documentation is the collection of resources that explain how to use each tool and provide examples, tutorials, guides, references, etc. Drizzle has a minimal documentation that covers the basic features and usage of the tool. You can find it on its <a href="https://orm.drizzle.team/">website</a> or <a href="https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm">GitHub repository</a>. Prisma has a comprehensive documentation that covers all the features and aspects of the tool. You can find it on its <a href="https://www.prisma.io/">website</a> or <a href="https://github.com/prisma">GitHub repository</a></p>
    <h3>Flexibility</h3>
    <p>Flexibility is another important aspect to consider when choosing between Drizzle and Prisma. Flexibility refers to the extent to which each tool allows you to customize and adapt it to your specific needs and preferences.</p>
    <p><strong>Drizzle</strong> offers a high level of flexibility due to its SQL-like syntax. If you are comfortable with SQL and prefer to write your queries in a manner similar to traditional SQL, Drizzle provides that flexibility. It also offers hooks and events that allow you to customize query and model behavior, giving you fine-grained control over your application's logic.</p>
    <p><strong>Prisma</strong>, on the other hand, abstracts away many SQL details, which can make it less flexible in terms of writing custom SQL queries. However, Prisma compensates for this by providing a rich set of features and integrations with other tools and frameworks. It is highly extensible, allowing you to integrate it seamlessly into various parts of your development stack.</p>
    <h2>Future Prospects</h2>
    <p>Consideration of the future prospects of Drizzle and Prisma is crucial for long-term project planning. Both tools have active development communities and ongoing updates, but they have different roadmaps and visions for the future.</p>
    <p><strong>Drizzle</strong> is a relatively newer tool with a focus on simplicity and performance. While it may have a smaller user base compared to Prisma, its development team is actively working on expanding its feature set and improving performance. Drizzle's roadmap includes plans for adding more database drivers and features in the coming releases.</p>

    title: "Blockchain Explained: The History, Concepts, and Features of Blockchain Technology",
    text: `<div><p>Blockchain is a technology that allows data to be stored and transferred in a secure, decentralized, and transparent way. Blockchain can be used for various purposes, such as cryptocurrencies, NFTs, smart contracts, and more. This blog post will explain the history, concepts, and features of blockchain technology.</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Blockchain is a term that refers to a system of storing and transferring data using blocks that are linked together by cryptographic hashes. The term blockchain was coined by Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, the first and most famous cryptocurrency that uses blockchain technology.</p>
    <p>The main purpose and goal of this blog post is to educate you on the basics of blockchain technology. You will learn about the origin and evolution of blockchain technology, the basic concepts and principles that underlie it, and the main features and advantages that it offers over traditional methods of data storage and transfer.</p>
    <p>By the end of this blog post, you will have a better understanding of what blockchain is, how it works, and why it is important in 2023 and beyond.</p>
    <h2>History of Blockchain Technology</h2>
    <p>Blockchain technology has its roots in the fields of cryptography, computer science, and distributed systems. The idea of using a chain of blocks to store data was first proposed by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta in 1991. They designed a system that used timestamps and digital signatures to create tamper-proof records of documents.</p>
    <p>However, the breakthrough that led to the creation of blockchain technology as we know it today came in 2008, when Satoshi Nakamoto published a whitepaper titled "<a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System</a>". In this paper, Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin, a digital currency that uses a peer-to-peer network to create and verify transactions without the need of a central authority or intermediary. Nakamoto also described the underlying mechanism that powers Bitcoin: a blockchain.</p>
    <p>A blockchain is a distributed ledger that records all the transactions that take place on the network. Each transaction is added to a block that contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. Each block is linked to the previous block by its hash, forming a chain of blocks (blockchain). The blockchain is maintained by the nodes (computers) on the network that follow a consensus algorithm to validate and update the ledger.</p>
    <p>The launch of the Bitcoin network and the creation of the first block (genesis block) took place on January 3rd, 2009. Since then, Bitcoin has grown to become the most popular and valuable cryptocurrency in the world, with a market capitalization of over $1 trillion as of April 2021.</p>
    <p>The success of Bitcoin inspired other developers and entrepreneurs to create their own cryptocurrencies and blockchain platforms based on different features and functionalities. Some of the most notable examples are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Ethereum:</strong> Ethereum is a blockchain platform that allows users to create and execute smart contracts: self-executing agreements that enforce the terms and conditions of a contract without the need of a third party or intermediary. Ethereum also supports the creation and exchange of tokens: digital assets that represent various values or utilities on the platform. Ethereum was launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin and others.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Litecoin:</strong> Litecoin is a cryptocurrency that is similar to Bitcoin but has faster transaction confirmation times and lower fees. Litecoin was created in 2011 by Charlie Lee as a fork (a copy or modification) of Bitcoin.</p>

    <h2>Concepts of Blockchain Technology</h2>
    <p>Blockchain technology is based on some basic concepts and principles that underlie its functionality and performance. These include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Distributed ledger:</strong> A distributed ledger is a database that is shared and synchronized among multiple nodes or participants in a network. Each node maintains a copy of the ledger and can validate and update it according to a consensus algorithm. A distributed ledger eliminates the need for a central authority or intermediary to manage or verify the data.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Block:</strong> A block is a unit of data that contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree). A block is linked to the previous block by its hash, forming a chain of blocks (blockchain). A block is immutable and irreversible once it is added to the blockchain.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Transaction:</strong> A transaction is an exchange or transfer of data or value between two or more parties in a network. A transaction is recorded and verified by the nodes in the network using cryptographic signatures. A transaction is added to a block once it is validated by the consensus algorithm.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Consensus algorithm:</strong> A consensus algorithm is a set of rules or protocols that govern how the nodes in a network agree on the state of the ledger. A consensus algorithm ensures that the ledger is consistent, accurate, and secure among all nodes. Some of the common types of consensus algorithms are proof-of-work (PoW), proof-of-stake (PoS), proof-of-authority (PoA), etc.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are some of the basic concepts and principles that underlie blockchain technology.</p>
    <h2>Features of Blockchain Technology</h2>
    <p>Blockchain technology offers some main features and advantages over traditional methods of data storage and transfer. These include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Security:</strong> Blockchain transactions are encrypted and verified by multiple nodes, making it difficult for hackers or malicious actors to tamper with or falsify them. Blockchain transactions also use public-key cryptography, which ensures that only the authorized parties can access or modify the data.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Transparency:</strong> Blockchain transactions are recorded and visible to anyone who has access to the network, making it easy for users to audit and verify them. Blockchain transactions also use timestamps, which ensure that the order and chronology of the data are preserved.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Blockchain transactions are processed faster and cheaper than traditional methods, as they do not require intermediaries or third parties to facilitate them. Blockchain transactions also use peer-to-peer communication, which reduces the latency and bandwidth consumption of the network.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are some of the main features and advantages of blockchain technology over traditional methods of data storage and transfer.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Blockchain's evolution from its inception in 2008 to its current state in 2023 has been remarkable. Its distributed ledger, block structure, cryptographic transactions, and consensus algorithms underpin its potential to reshape industries across the globe.

    title: "A Complete Guide to Next Js: A React Js Framework",
    text: `<div><h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>In the world of React, Next JS is one of the most popular frameworks for React. Next.js is a simple development environment built on top of React. It has a short learning curve, but even developers new to front-end development can learn it quickly. Therefore, developing a project with Next JS vs React JS is a unique experience. Comparing Next.js vs React, Next.js is a React framework, on the other hand, React is just a JavaScript library.</p>
    <p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CcoKbF2h8BIMkGKr4RNjDVJBZEv-78En_r3R8FZCMH2tXn98O7nEqmiYWVhc6iqECJGIwAZFj4DEwHJmyjBxy59T1S5nRvCwhd3EtpUj2WhjP3y3bt91YByUvws0gDgfxgk9XvZygs3v0_5b69fGvtXGYGk2_uDJ5jOP8QRhyuBcJfojAJzjVUbJ3g" alt=""/></p>
    <p>What is Next js?</p>
    <p>Developed by Vercel, Next.js is open source and JavaScript Framework, allowing you to create fast and user-friendly web applications and static websites using React. In fact, it is based on Node.js and Babel, and it is integrated with React for creating single-page applications. This makes the Server-side simple and easy.</p>
    <h3>Why should I use Next js?</h3>
    <p>Next.js offers many features, such as static export, preview mode, initial rendering, fast compilation, and automatic building size optimization. In my opinion, the current version of Next.js is what React has been missing for a long time. Next, JS includes all the features you’ll need to build an app. Next.js is a very popular framework for making hybrid web applications.</p>
    <h3>Key Features of Next js</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Built-in CSS Support:<br>
    Next.js permits us to import CSS records from an HTML file. This is possible because Next.js expands the concept of importing past JavaScript.<br>
    Nextjs naturally uses styled-jsx for styling by default, so all stylings between tags are separated for each page. In this manner, we don’t need to worry about overriding them.<br>
    <br>
    Styles are being made on both client and server sides so after entering a site we get a legitimate style. Obviously, this arrangement has its benefits and drawbacks yet fortunately in Next.js, it's not hard to set up so styled - jsx isn't needed. We can utilize CSS-in - JS instead and the basic principle is to make use of inline styles.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ol start="2">
    <li>Image Component and Image Optimization:<br>
    <br>
    Since version 10.1.0, Next.JS features an inherent Image Component. The Next.JS Image Component is an extension of the HTML&nbsp; component, advanced for the modern web.<br>
    The automatic image optimization considers resizing, developing, and serving pictures in a current configuration like WebP when the client upholds it. This attempts not to transport huge images to devices with a smaller viewport, and it likewise enables Next.JS to subsequently embrace future picture formats and convey them to clients supporting those formats.<br>
    <br>
    automatic image optimization works with any picture source, regardless of whether the picture is supported by an external data source, such as a CMS, it can anyway be enhanced.</li>
    <li>Static File Serving<br>
    Another feature of NextJS is that it can serve files from the root directory (/) as well as any subdirectory. For example, if you create a file named me.jpg in the /public folder, you could access it via public/me.png</li>
    <li>Typescript<br>
    Next.js gives you a coordinated TypeScript experience right out of the box. You can make a typescript project using create next-applications utilizing the --ts, --typescript flags like so:<br>
    npx create-next-app --ts# oryarn create next-app --typescript</li>
    <li>Supported Browsers and Features<br>
    Next.js supports every cutting-edge browser (IE11, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera) with no necessary design. We straightforwardly infuse polyfills needed for compatibility with IE11. \ \ These polyfills aren’t supposed to be included in the production build to avoid duplicated code. Also, to lessen bundle size, we compare React vs Next.js without loading these polyfills for clients who don't require them. Most web traffic all around the globe doesn’t download these polyfills.</li>
    <li>ESLint<br>
    Next Js current release 11 gives an integrated ESLinter experience. All you have t do is add next.eslint as a script to your package.json file:<br>
    A configuration process will not be provided to those who do not have ESLint configured in their applications yet</li>
    <li>Automatic Code Splitting<br>
    Pages are basic features in NextJS and they are loaded with simply the libraries and Javascript that they require no more. Rather than having one single JavaScript file containing all the application code. The application is separated naturally by next.js in a few separate assets. \ \ Loading a page merely loads the JavaScript essentials for the specific page. Nextjs does that by dissecting the resources imported.,. If by some stroke of good fortune one of your pages imports axios, for example, that particular page will contain the library for its package.<br>
    <br>
    This ensures your first-page load gets as fast as possible, along with subsequent page loads sending the JavaScript expected to the client. There is one notable exception. As often as possible. Used imports are moved into the primary JavaScript file in case they are used in part to half of the site.</li>
    <li>Fast Refresh<br>
    Fast Refresh is a next.js feature that gives quick feedback on altars created to your react parts. Fast Refresh is enabled of course in all next.js applications on 9 or more current versions. When you edit a record that exports React component(s), the fast refresh will refresh the code just on that document, and yet once more render your component. \ \ You may change anything in that record, consisting of styles, delivering logic, occasion controllers, or impacts. When you alter a record that doesn’t export React components, the fast refresh will re-run both this document and various records bringing in it</li>
    <li>Meta Tags<br>
    If you’ve chosen next.js, it means that you’re concerned about the SEO of your app. In addition, everyone who needs to handle website streamlining thinks about how to characterize their own, independent titles, tags, and representations for each page.<br>
    <br>
    Fortunately, there's no problem with describing your own, independent titles, descriptions, and representations for each webpage. The Head component is designed to include them and it’s accessible straight out of the box as an element of Next.js. To import Head from 'next'/head and glue the accompanying code into the render function.</li>
    <li>Routing<br>
    Next.js is an open-source static site generator built on top of Node.js and Express. It allows developers to build fast, modern apps without worrying about server-side rendering, routing, or state management. With Next.js, we just need to make a record in the pages directory.</li>
    <li>Lazy loading<br>
    A lazy loading feature in NextJS causes your application's performance to improve. Sometimes the page may set aside efforts to load. The client may abandon your application if the load takes longer than 30 seconds.<br>
    The best approach to avoid this is to use some trick to show the user that the page is loading. For example, you can display a spinning wheel. Code splitting or lazy loading is one of the tools that allow you to manage and control slow loading so you only load the essential code on your page.</li>
    <li>Layouts<br>
    The React model permits developers to deconstruct a page's content into a progression of components, including header, sidebar, main content, and footer. Each component can be reused across multiple pages. For example, you might have a similar navigation bar and footer on every page.</li>
    <li>Data Fetching</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now let’s talk a little bit about the three unique NextJS features for data fetching. First off, we’ll start with server-side rendering.<br>
    The thing that matters here is when it renders the HTML for a page. Next.js offers two options for pre-rendering: static generation and server-side rendering. For a static generation, the HTML is produced at build-time and will be reused on every request. For server-side rendering, the HTML is produced on each page load. Critically, Next.js lets you choose which pre-rendering method you'd prefer to use per page. You can make a Hybrid app by utilizing static generation for most pages and server-side rendering for others.</p>
    <h3>Server-side rendering and static site generation with Next JS</h3>
    <p>React, Angular, and Vue are used to build Single Page Applications (SPA). But they all provide CSR, which means the entire application is rendered client-side by the browser. So, therefore, our first page will take some time to render. So to render our pages much faster, we can use Next.js (Framework for React), which renders our pages server-side and gives us the pre-rendered HTML for our pages.</p>
    <h4>Two Types of Pre-Rendering</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Server-Side Rendering: HTML is generated on each user request.</li>
    <li>Static Generation (SSG): HTML is generated at build time.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What is Server Side Rendering (SSR)</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;When a user requests a web page, the server prepares the page by retrieving user-specific data and sending it to the user's machine. The browser then interprets the content and renders the page. The whole process of getting data from the database, creating an HTML page and making it available to the user is known as SSR.</p>
    <h3>How Next.js helps in SSR</h3>
    <p>Next.js creates an HTML page at build time and uses minimal JavaScript code to serve the pre-rendered page from the server to the browser. When the browser loads the page, its JavaScript code executes the page and makes it fully interactive. (This process is called hydration)</p>
    <h3>What is Static Site Generation?</h3>
    <p>Static generation describes the process of building and rendering a website or application at build time. The output is a set of static files, including the HTML file itself and resources such as JavaScript and CSS. If you haven’t heard of Static Site Generation, but the term sounds familiar, you may have heard of its longer name, Static Site Generation, or its acronym SSG.</p>
    <h2>Benefits Of Using Next js</h2>
    <p>In summary, the main advantages of Next.js are:</p>
    <p>Better development process Save time and money for our customers</p>
    <p>Better performance: Faster application</p>
    <p>Better SEO: More indexable applications and SEO</p>

    title: "How to pass coding tests and assessments for a software developer job",
    text: `<div><p>Coding tests can be difficult sometimes to get through on the spot. Especially the prelude session of any job process requires logical assessment test, that is basically, you writing a script within a defined period of time that too without any online help! Lets dig further on how you can ace it. A polished resume will not ensure success in a coding test. A lack of preparation is a major reason why engineers fail coding tests. A coding test requires preparation and a lot of practise.</p>
    <p>I have been through these times and understand how one feels while stressing out before stepping in to this big step towards their career. I can assure you that Toptal, Turing, TestGorilla or any other platform's test can be easily cleared if you are determined and focused. Furthermore, except for having skills here are some of the little things that could be considered before starting this journey!</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.techloset.com/images/cms-media/how-to-ace-your-coding-assesment.png" alt=""/></p>
    <h2>Practice, Practice, Practice!</h2>
    <p>Understand and practise the fundamentals of programming, including variable declaration, operators, looping structures, control structures, and programme structure. You already know how to code, but you should review and refresh your knowledge of the fundamentals.</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.techloset.com/images/cms-media/techloset-blogs.png" alt=""/></p>
    <p>Although it may seem obvious, practising your coding skills is the best way to keep them sharp. Work on solving difficult coding problems.</p>
    <p>Develop new approaches and refine your coding to produce the most efficient and elegant code possible. To practise, use online coding websites.</p>
    <p>Coding tests come with written instructions, so read them thoroughly and take your time before beginning. Take your time. Keep track of the time, but don't overlook important details.</p>
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>Some tech firms repeatedly ask the same coding questions; in this case, practise common questions and try to solve them in various ways of determining which is the most efficient and appropriate. However, if the company delegates random coding test problems, be prepared for the unexpected and practise solving unusual coding challenges.</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.techloset.com/images/cms-media/techloset-blog-post-how-to-ace-coding-tests.png" alt="TechloSet Solutions "/></p>
    <p>But Remember! Because engineering and computing are such broad subjects, any type of question could arise, so don't limit yourself to the standard ones. Investigate related topics. Basic discrete math, machine learning, and generic systems engineering are examples of subjects that may be related to coding and software development.</p>
    <h2>Relax</h2>
    <p>Interviewers/evaluators will notice and provide feedback on how you solve specific coding problems. Always be patient and polite, and take any feedback to improve your performance the next time. Be open to constructive feedback. Because of time constraints and the pressure that you may feel while solving a coding test, your coding will never be perfect.</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.techloset.com/images/cms-media/rleax-in-coding-text-techloset-blog-post.png" alt="TechloSet Solutions "/></p>
    <p>Take the coding exam seriously, but don't become overwhelmed or stressed: Always remain humble, open-minded, and friendly. Remember that your interviewers are also people who just want the best for you.</p>
    <p>Coding tests are used to assess your technical ability as an engineering candidate. It allows engineering managers to assess your technical level while also taking into account your soft skills. As a result, whether you pass or fail the interview is not always determined by the results of your coding test.</p>

    title: "How to Get a Software Development Job? Step-by-Step Guide",
    text: `<div><p>This article walks you through the step-by-step procedure of securing a position as a software developer in a competitive market. I have covered various aspects of the process along with some helpful tips.</p>
    <p>Getting a software development job is not an easy task. There are many things you need to keep in mind as you look for your first software developer position. But it doesn’t have to be scary. We understand that getting a job as a software developer can be challenging, but with the right strategy and preparation, you can land an amazing software engineer role in no time. You see, grabbing your first software development job isn’t easy if you don’t know the right direction to take. Unless you have friends or acquaintances who are developers, you might find it hard to get a suitable position as a software engineer or programmer because of several factors.</p>
    <h2>Who is a Software Developer?</h2>
    <p>A software developer writes and tests computer programs that either manage the delivery of the program or operate it. In short, they are the people responsible for building websites, desktop applications and mobile applications. They write code and are responsible for the maintenance of the apps as well. They are the brains behind the apps, the internet, and the technology we use in our daily lives. Whether you are shopping online, watching videos, playing games, or just socializing; you are, most probably, interacting with a piece of software developed by a software engineer.</p>
    <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
    <h2>Types of Software Developers?</h2>
    <p>Software engineers can be broadly classified into two categories - Backend Developer and Frontend developer.</p>
    <p>Who is a Full Stack Software Developer?</p>
    <p>A full-stack software developer is a person who is capable of working on both client and server-side applications. They are usually skilled in all development aspects, from front-end to back-end, which includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and programming languages like PHP, Python, and Java. It’s important for a full stack developer to be proficient in all of these areas since the whole point of building an application is to have it look good and function properly on both the web and mobile platforms.</p>
    <p>Language skills are also important to have when it comes to full stack development because a lot of times different languages are used in combination. So if you are not familiar with them all, then you will need to spend time learning each one individually.</p>
    <h2>Finding the Right Job According to your Skill</h2>
    <p>Finding the right job according to your skill is important. You can’t expect to get a job as a software engineer if you only have experience in software development. If you are fresh out of college and want to become a software engineer, then you must focus on building your programming skills.</p>
    <p>It’s not enough just to have a degree in computer scienc or engineering. If you have some experience in software development, then focus on building your portfolio and strengthening your skills. You can try to increase your knowledge in some new domains or create a side project to showcase your skills.</p>
    <p>If you have experience in a certain field, like finance or healthcare, then you can also apply for a job as a software engineer in that field. For example, if you are an accountant and want to become a software engineer, then you can apply for a job as a software engineer in the finance industry. Let’s take a look at some of the best opportunities for software developers in your city.</p>

Preludes, technical rounds, coding tests, assessments and what not. It must be difficult in figuring out<a href="https://www.techloset.com/blog/How-to-pass-coding-tests-and-assessments-for-a-software-developer-job"> How to pass coding tests and assessments for a software developer job</a>. Let’s now dig into what next is going to be served in your plate.</p>
    <h3></h3>
    <p>Environment Setup: Tech-knowledge</p>
    <p>It is normal for employers to get kick started by seniors on their first day and getting familiar with things, in any other field. But, the developers, us, sometimes over-estimate ourselves and tend to portray that “We know it all” – Don’t do it, just don’t! The best practice is to ask about the tools during interview or in the onboarding session and prepare yourself accordingly. You will leave a remarkable impression if you come fully prepared on the first day of your joining with all the required tools knowledge.</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.techloset.com/images/blog-media/learn-software-development-technology-techloset.png" alt=""/></p>
    <p>Since, Software development is not just about writing code and programming, it is a process that involves teams and requires communication. Although the directory structure will be unfamiliar to you, you should be able to navigate it using familiar commands. If you're using Linux, you'll most likely need to be familiar with the bash shell and the standard commands for managing directories, files, and permissions, as well as how to ssh into a server. Similarly, you'll need to be familiar with Mac's terminal. Windows is tricky; you'll most likely need to know the traditional command line prompt, as well as Powershell. Before you arrive for your first day, inquire.</p>
    <p>The build system will come next. What you need to know is determined by the language. You'll probably need to know gulp, npm, and other tools for node.js. There will be libraries as well. Most languages now have dozens of open source libraries that are widely used. The more you know about these, the better. You can check<a href="https://www.techloset.com/blog/how-to-install-node-js-locally-with-node-version-manager-nvm"> How to Install Node.js Locally with Node Version Manager (nvm)</a> before your joining.</p>
    <h2>Do's and Don'ts</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>Do ask a lot of questions</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Do learn who you should reach out for help</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Do learn team member's names</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Do make notes</p>

    <p>Don't shy away from asking things you are new to.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Don't sit alone for entire day!</p>
    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Work hard and stay committed in any case. Perform the tasks assigned to you by your project manager. Don't be afraid to express your concerns. The first day will pass quickly, and before you know it, you'll be settled in and no longer the new person. &nbsp;But first, have some fun and get through the first day of work.</p>

    title: "What to Look for in a Front End Developer: A Comprehensive Guide",
    text: `<div><p>Front-end development is an extremely challenging and rewarding field. The demand for front-end developers has grown significantly over the last few years, and this trend isn’t coming down anytime soon. Front-end engineers are highly in demand because they have a direct impact on how users experience websites and applications. In fact, studies show that nearly 90% of user experience is based on the front end of a website or application. This means that hiring front-end developers are essential for the success of your business. But it can be tricky to find the right talent for your organization. After all, there are many different skill sets required to excel as a front-end engineer. If you’re looking to hire a new front-end engineer or bring one onto your team, we’ve compiled some helpful tips below:</p>
    <h2>What is a Front end Developer?</h2>
    <p>A front-end developer is someone who works with both the design team as well as the back-end engineering team to create the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of a website or application. These developers are responsible for things like creating the visual elements, designing the layout, and debugging the site or application. Front-end engineers use frameworks such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the UI and UX of a website or application. Therefore, it’s essential to find front-end engineers who are skilled with these frameworks.</p>
    <h2>Check your requirements and be specific on what you want and why you need a front-end developer.</h2>
    <p>Like any other hiring process, it’s important to first define the role and the responsibilities for the position. Determine what the ideal candidate will do on a day-to-day basis, as well as their long-term goals for the role. It’s also essential to identify what skills you are looking for and whether or not they are required for the position. If you are hiring a front-end developer, be sure to include requirements such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other relevant technology skills. Make sure you are specific in the requirements you’re looking for. This will help narrow down the candidate pool and make the hiring process much more efficient.</p>
    <h2>Ask candidates about the technology or framework you are planning to use.</h2>
    <p>If you are hiring a front-end developer, it’s important to ask them about the technologies and frameworks they would use on a daily basis. For example, if you want to use React, it would be helpful to ask the candidate why they would choose it over other JavaScript frameworks. This will help you get a better understanding of their knowledge and what they’ve been exposed to throughout their career.</p>
    <h2>Be transparent from the beginning.</h2>
    <p>Nobody wants to be misled or deceived. Therefore, being transparent from the start is essential for the front-end developer hiring process. From the start, you should inform the candidates about what to expect in the hiring process, when they can expect to hear from you, and any other relevant details. If you are looking to build a transparent, honest, and reliable company, the front-end developer hiring process is a great place to start.</p>
    <h2>What makes a good front-end Developer?</h2>
    <p>When searching for a front-end engineer, it’s important to assess the candidate’s skill level and determine if they are right for the position. The following are some traits and skills that are essential for a front-end engineer:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Problem-solving skills: Front-end engineers must be able to overcome challenges and solve problems. This is especially true when dealing with clients. Therefore, problem-solving skills are key to managing the client relationship.</li>
    <li>Communication skills: Engineers must be able to communicate effectively with clients, designers, and other members of the engineering team.</li>
    <li>Analytical skills: Front-end engineers have to be able to analyze data, metrics, and results to find patterns and create solutions.</li>
    <li>Attention to detail: Front-end engineers must be able to pay attention to small details. This includes everything from using the correct spelling to following coding standards.</li>
    <li>Creativity: Front-end engineers must be creative and able to think out of the box.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Try to find front-end engineers who are already familiar with the tools and technologies you’re using</h2>
    <p>If you have an engineering team already in place, it’s a good idea to find a candidate who is already familiar with the tools and technologies you use. If a candidate is already familiar with your tools, it will make the onboarding process much quicker and easier. This will help streamline the transition from candidate to employee.</p>
    <h2>Check for understanding of user-experience basics</h2>
    <p>It’s important to understand the basics of user experience design, especially if your company is focused on improving user experience. However, it’s important to note that having an in-depth understanding of UX design isn’t a requirement for all engineers. Understanding the basics will help engineers better communicate with designers and create a better user experience. It’s important to note that having a basic understanding of UX design doesn’t necessarily mean sitting through a short online course. It’s more about understanding the importance of the role of user experience design within the engineering process. It’s also important to assess the engineer’s ability to work with others and manage the relationship between the design team and the engineering team.</p>
    <h2>Ask candidates to build a small demo before making a final decision</h2>
    <p>It’s always helpful to ask candidates to perform a small task before making a final decision. This is a great way to gauge their skills and see how they work in a real-life scenario. It can also help you better understand their thought process and the decisions they make when completing a project. The best project to ask the candidate to complete is one that is similar to what they would be doing for your organization. However, it’s important to give them a project that is realistic enough for them to complete within a reasonable amount of time.</p>
    <h2>Good communication is key</h2>
    <p>As mentioned above, communication is essential between engineers and the design team. But communication is also important among the engineers themselves. Front-end engineers must be able to effectively communicate with one another on the engineering team. This includes being able to communicate with back-end engineers and engineering management.</p>
    <h2>Hiring an individual vs Hiring a front-end development company</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>H&#xFEFF;iring an individual:<br>
    <br>
    If you're looking to hire an Individual, make sure they have the right skill set for your project. Browse through their portfolio, check out their website, and see if they've got any projects similar to yours. Ask them what tools they use for design and project management, and if they don't have good answers, it's a big red flag and an indication they may not have enough experience. Remember, you're hiring one person, so everything depends on them.</li>
    <li>H&#xFEFF;iring a Development Company<br>
    <br>
    When you hire an Individual developer, you’re not paying for someone else’s time; you’re paying for theirs. You get what you pay for. An individual might be able to do everything you need in a day or two, but that doesn’t mean he’s worth his hourly rate. Some individuals are great at doing things quickly, but they lack the skills to deliver quality code. Others are great at delivering quality code, but they’re slow. And then there are those who are both quick and skilled.If you’re looking to build a website, you should consider hiring a professional team of developers like <a href="https://www.techloset.com/about">Techloset Solutions</a> who believe in delivering you with the complete experience of entering a closet brimming with cutting-edge technology that you will never want to depart. These professionals know how to create beautiful designs and layouts that make your site stand out from the crowd. They also know how to optimize your site so that it loads faster and performs better. Hire professionals who specialize in front-end development because they’ll understand the ins and outs of this platform and know how to implement the best practices into your site.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Front-end development is an essential part of any engineering team. It’s important to find engineers who are skilled in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and other relevant languages. When hiring a front-end engineer, it’s important to assess the candidate’s skill level and determine if they have a basic understanding of UX design. It’s also important to assess the candidate’s ability to work with others and manage the relationship between the design team and the engineering team.</p>

    <h2>What is React.js and How Does It Work?</h2>
    <p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2qSFs5yUza9Ii5l7k9VAH7bt3p8qW8pgsXGxZAH72hlnoq9dPjhu9EJasdX7eDRc22uOCuMPS_qc77mIT9SNVBhQGlDInw6AyN9ZDt4hh7_exkZgY5HgC0M15ZkUGuWsXQK3b4uOOReZYC99HgaT5UFt0jPk3hy4lSvIgHsM7wlyrC98aO7hTgDy6Q" alt=""/></p>
    <h3>What is React.js?</h3>
    <p>React is a Javascript library for building user interfaces developed and maintained by Facebook. It was initially released in 2013 and was open-sourced in 2013. Today, React is one of the most popular libraries for creating user interfaces in Web apps, particularly Single Page Apps (SPAs). Its core concept is that your UI should be built as a composition of self-contained components that interact with each other.</p>
    <p>React primarily uses a “virtual DOM” implementation that optimizes the way information is exchanged between the browser and the servers hosting your application. A React component is a chunk of UI that can be reused in different parts of your app.<br>
    For example, a button component can be used on your login screen, your sign-up screen, and your settings page. Components are the basic building blocks of interactivity in React apps.</p>
    <h3>How does React work?</h3>
    <p>The key behind React’s success is the virtual DOM, which helps React build a lightweight and highly efficient representation of what the UI should look like. This virtual DOM is then used to calculate the minimal set of changes that need to occur in the browser’s DOM in order to produce the desired UI.</p>
    <p>The virtual DOM is a representation of the browser’s Document Object Model, the standard scheme by which all browsers represent and organize webpages. The DOM is a tree-like data structure that organizes content on a web page, like images, headlines, and paragraphs, into a hierarchy that all browsers can understand.</p>
    <h3>Why has React been so successful?</h3>
    <p>The first thing to note is that, despite being created by Facebook, React is an open-source library. This means that it can be used by anyone for any purpose with no licensing obligations. Furthermore, the React codebase is written in JSX, a very readable Javascript syntax extension that uses XML-like tags. JSX is a bit of a standard in the React community, and its use is necessary for using React.</p>
    <p>This has contributed to the popularity of React. React’s popularity can also be attributed to its “learn once, run anywhere” philosophy. It has been designed with simplicity and flexibility in mind so that it can be used in a wide range of projects.</p>
    <p>This is mainly achieved through the use of component-based UI architecture. Components are reusable, modular UI elements that can be used in any part of your application. Since components are self-contained and don’t rely on other parts of the codebase, they can be used anywhere with minimal effort and no code duplication.</p>
    <h3>Where Can You Use React?</h3>
    <p>React is a completely modular library that can be used to construct applications in a number of different areas. The most common uses of React are in building web applications with JavaScript, Furthermore, many companies also use React for building websites, including Coursera, Lyft, Netflix, and Discord.</p>
    <h3>Future of React</h3>
    <p>React is one of the most popular front-end libraries in existence, and it is only getting more popular with time. Although React is currently in version 16, Facebook has already started working on its next generation of the technology, codenamed React Next. React Next uses a completely new design philosophy and architecture and comes with a number of advantages over its predecessor.</p>
    <p>There are a few things to note about React Next. First of all, React Next is not a sequel to the current version of React. It is a completely different framework, and it is important to note that the two will not interoperate.</p>
    <h3>Pros of Using React.js:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>It has a large developer community.</li>
    <li>There are tons of resources available to learn how to use it, from books to articles to videos.</li>
    <li>It is easy to learn how to use. The core concepts behind using React are simple and straightforward.</li>
    <li>It is modular, which allows you to create reusable UI components. This means that you can use the same components in different parts of an application.</li>
    <li>It is scalable. React is highly performant and is used on a number of large-scale applications, including the likes of Discord, Netflix, and Lyft.</li>
    <li>It is open source, which means that you can use it free of charge.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cons of Using React.js:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>It is only available as a Javascript library, so you will need to use a compilation tool to use it with other languages.</li>
    <li>There is a steep learning curve associated with React, particularly for those with little to no JavaScript experience.</li>
    <li>It is not well-suited for building websites that require lots of heavy interactivity between server-side and client-side code.</li>
    <li>It does not come with a ton of pre-built features, so you will need to write a lot of code to build even the most basic of applications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is Vue js and How Does It Work?</h2>
    <p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/qYXYAq3qoqnNbhSGfBFuUDC7Wvxkqp_7SsAXBjZ70w0NVwD3NxAXzUR-z6knDD_JlmZKo7kCZt0MhJoIegHCK4dVtRh7qnDYoAk5BLnvCRv0oxWbP3inNJmGBsfRwMrfRHV5s7fPI9KWJ3Vcqlm0M-jbheXyEtI0qoSHxbbF6UwVD9gMQcDe9x3IdQ" alt=""/></p>
    <h3>What is Vue.js?</h3>
    <p>Vue.js is a progressive and incrementally adoptable framework for building User Interfaces. It is used for building reactive user interfaces and also coordinating data between components by using a Virtual DOM. With a concise and flexible syntax, this framework is easy to learn. It has a strong ecosystem with various plugins and tools to choose from. Vue.js is a great choice for modern web application development. It works especially well with an incrementally-adoptable approach to building applications, where you can choose the parts of the application that make sense to build with Vue and leave the rest as regular JavaScript.</p>
    <h3>How does Vue js work?</h3>
    <p>The Vue.js development process has three main stages. - Build - In this stage, we’ll install the Vue CLI to generate a new project and start a development server. - Code - We’ll create two components to render the home page and build the app with the router. - Deploy - We’ll deploy our app to a production server and perform a code audit. The build process is where the code is compiled and bundled into a single file. And the coding process is where we write the code, which will be compiled during the build process. The build and code processes are done in two different stages and are independent of each other.</p>
    <h3>Future of Vue Js</h3>
    <p>With the recent release of Vue 3.0, Vue has more than 50K stars on Github, more than 7000 forks and 400 contributors. With a long list of achievements in the past, Vue has created waves in the tech industry by promising new features in the upcoming updates. It’s been two years since Vue’s last major version has been released. Vue 2 was the first major release of Vue and was touted as being a “modern, component-based, UI Framework”. It offered a new way of structuring applications and brought with it a lot of excitement. But now it’s time to welcome Vue 3.0!</p>
    <h3>Best way to learn Vue Js</h3>
    <p>The best way to learn is by building something real. It will help you stay motivated, and you’ll actually have something to show for it at the end. Online courses are great, but the problem with them is that once you’ve completed the course, there’s nothing keeping you accountable and motivated. You’ll have to decide how much time you want to invest in learning the language, and if you’re going to go at a slower pace, online courses may not be the best option.</p>
    <h3>Pros of using Vue JS</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Blazing fast - Vue is one of the fastest frameworks out there. It achieves this blazing speed by using a virtual DOM.</li>
    <li>Great support for dynamic updates - It also allows your users to see the changes as they happen without reloading the page.</li>
    <li>Easy to maintain - With Vue, your codebase is well-organized, and it’s easier to understand each component.</li>
    <li>Easy to learn - Because of its simplicity, it’s easy for beginners to learn the framework.</li>
    <li>Incrementally adoptable - You can choose to use Vue for the parts of the app that make sense.</li>
    <li>Great community - With a large and helpful community, you’ll find answers to your questions easily.</li>
    <li>Great documentation - It’s easy to get started because of the detailed documentation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cons of using Vue JS</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>One of the problems with Vue is that its biggest community is located in China, which can be problematic in the case of some packages or research. There are a lot of packages made by Chinese Vue.js developers, who write documentation in their native language.</li>
    <li>Vue offers significant flexibility, which offers a lot of freedom in using different approaches. Big projects can lead to problems with the inconsistency of code.</li>
    <li>Vue.js developers can feel a bit of a lack of plugins and libraries. The most important ones exist in the Vue version, but more specific requirements can meet problems with founding fitting libraries</li>
    </ul>

    title: "What is Hybrid Mobile Application?",
    text: `<div><p>A (hybrid app) is a software application that incorporates elements of both native and web apps. Hybrid apps are primarily web apps wrapped in a native app shell. Once downloaded from an app store and installed locally, the shell can connect to whatever capabilities the mobile platform provides via an embedded browser in the app. The browser and its plug-ins are inaccessible to the end user and run on the back end.</p>
    <p><img src="https://www.techloset.com/images/cms-media/app-explainer-video-template-1-.png" alt="HybridVsNative" title="Hybrid Mobile Apps Vs Native " /></p>
    <p>Hybrid applications are essential for enabling developers to build software for a smartphone device only once while still supporting multiple platforms.
