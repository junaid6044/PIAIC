Here are some examples of **real-time problems** in the software field that can be used for few-shot prompting scenarios:

---

### 1. **Bug Severity Classification**
**Task**: Classify software bugs into categories like "critical", "major", "minor", or "cosmetic".  
**Examples**:
   - "The application crashes whenever a user tries to log in." → **critical**
   - "The loading animation is missing on the home page." → **minor**
   - "The font size in the footer is inconsistent." → **cosmetic**

---

### 2. **Feature Request Prioritization**
**Task**: Prioritize feature requests based on their impact and feasibility as "high", "medium", or "low".  
**Examples**:
   - "Add multi-factor authentication for enhanced security." → **high**
   - "Enable dark mode for better user experience." → **medium**
   - "Customize notification sounds for each user." → **low**

---

### 3. **Commit Message Review**
**Task**: Review commit messages for clarity and best practices, labeling them as "good", "needs improvement", or "bad".  
**Examples**:
   - "Fixes issue with API authentication timeout." → **good**
   - "Fix API bug." → **needs improvement**
   - "Bug fixed." → **bad**

---

### 4. **DevOps Alert Classification**
**Task**: Categorize DevOps alerts into "critical", "warning", or "info".  
**Examples**:
   - "CPU usage exceeded 90% for 15 minutes." → **critical**
   - "Disk space usage is above 75%." → **warning**
   - "Daily backup completed successfully." → **info**

---

### 5. **Code Review Feedback Categorization**
**Task**: Categorize code review comments as "logic error", "style issue", or "suggestion".  
**Examples**:
   - "The variable name is unclear; consider renaming for better readability." → **style issue**
   - "This function doesn’t handle edge cases properly." → **logic error**
   - "Consider optimizing this loop for better performance." → **suggestion**

---

### 6. **User Feedback Sentiment Analysis**
**Task**: Classify user feedback for a software product as "positive", "negative", or "neutral".  
**Examples**:
   - "This app is fantastic! It makes my work so much easier." → **positive**
   - "The app keeps crashing, and it’s very frustrating." → **negative**
   - "It’s okay, but I think it could be faster." → **neutral**

---

### 7. **Error Log Severity Classification**
**Task**: Categorize error logs into "critical", "warning", or "info".  
**Examples**:
   - "Database connection failed: Timeout exceeded." → **critical**
   - "Configuration file not found, loading default values." → **warning**
   - "Application started successfully." → **info**

---

### 8. **API Endpoint Testing Results**
**Task**: Classify API test results as "passed", "failed", or "partially passed".  
**Examples**:
   - "The GET /users endpoint returned a 200 OK with correct data." → **passed**
   - "The POST /login endpoint returned a 500 Internal Server Error." → **failed**
   - "The PUT /update endpoint worked but failed to update the last field." → **partially passed**

---

### 9. **Security Issue Identification**
**Task**: Categorize security issues as "high-risk", "medium-risk", or "low-risk".  
**Examples**:
   - "SQL injection vulnerability detected in login form." → **high-risk**
   - "The password reset email link expires after 1 hour, but could be longer." → **medium-risk**
   - "HTTPS is used, but no HSTS policy is set." → **low-risk**

---

### 10. **Code Merge Conflict Resolution Suggestions**
**Task**: Suggest the resolution type for merge conflicts as "manual resolution", "keep branch A", or "keep branch B".  
**Examples**:
   - "Function implementation differs between branches." → **manual resolution**
   - "Branch A added new comments, Branch B did not modify the file." → **keep branch A**
   - "Branch B updated the README, Branch A made no changes." → **keep branch B**
